Test Repository to explore GitHub

This repository is purely to explore and test functionality of GitHub for Sezoo.digital

Going to make the setting for this repo public to enable exploring pages.

Now I want to add an image using mermaid. First I'll have to work out how to add mermaid as a capability. The text below (which starts and ends with an html body tag) is from the mermaid user guide. This text should render as a diagram when I have mermaid installed.

<body>
  Here is a mermaid diagram:
  <pre class="mermaid">
        graph TD
        A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
        B --> C[Server01]
        B --> D[Server02]
  </pre>
</body>
